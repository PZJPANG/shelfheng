## Database Considerations

Your app uses SQLite which works great for development, but for production you might want to consider:
- **Railway**: Offers free PostgreSQL addon
- **Render**: Provides free PostgreSQL database
- **Heroku**: Has PostgreSQL addon

## Environment Variables (if needed)
- `PORT`: Automatically set by hosting platform
- `SECRET_KEY`: Add a random secret key for production

## Troubleshooting
- Check logs in your hosting platform's dashboard
- Make sure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Verify your app runs locally with `python app.py`
